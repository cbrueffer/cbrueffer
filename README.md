I'm a freelance bioinformatician and data scientist available for hire through my company [InSilico Consulting AB](https://insilico.consulting). Based in [Lund, Sweden](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Lund/@55.7049723,13.156711,13z/), I'm conveniently located close to Denmark and Germany.

My focus in both academia and industry has been the exploration of cancer through genomic methods. See [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=BFnR7W8AAAAJ) for a list of my research publications.

As an active open source software developer I focus on providing up-to-date software packages to the bioinformatics and data science community through [Bioconda](https://bioconda.github.io) and [conda-forge](https://conda-forge.org), and improving various other software projects through my contributions.
